# apps-over-dtn

This repo contains configurations for enabling email and http over a DTN (aka Bundle Protocol) network. These were used for a testbed with many beta testers in 2023. That testbed has been put out of service, but the configuration and scripts are offered here for people to test.

IETF Internet drafts were written to describe these implementations.
